\section{Boost Method}
\subsection{Adaboost}

Adaboost is a method which keep fixing the error classfication data. Similar to Tree method, this method is a recursive (iterative you might say) defined. The key is the error loss function.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  &E_m = \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_m(i) \cdot e^{-\alpha_m h_m(x_i) \cdot y_i}\\
  &w_m(i) = e^{-y_i \cdot C_{m-1}(x_i)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
